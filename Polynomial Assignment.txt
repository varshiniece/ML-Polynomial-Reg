Overview of the Problem Statement

Dataset
First lets look at the dataset. It is Position_Salaries.csv and can be found here
It has 3 columns - "Position", "Level" and "Salary" and describes the approximate salary range for an employee based on what level he falls under.

For example if an employee is a Manager - he falls in Level 4 and should get around $80,000.

Project Objective
Lets assume the above table is what the HR team of a company uses to determine what salary to offer to a new employee. 
For our project, let's take an example that an employee has applied for the role of a Regional Manager and has already worked as a Regional Manager for 2 years. 
So based on the table above - he falls between level 6 and level 7 - Lets say he falls under level 6.5
We want to build a model to predict what salary we should offer this new employee.


1. Use Linear Model and Visualise the Plot 
2. Use Polynomial Regression and Visualise the Plot Properly.
3. Use Proper Diagonistics to show the accuracy and error of the Model
4. Perform the task both in Excel and Python
5. Create a Proper Presentation regarding the Use Case.
6. Share the html of the Python Note book only.
